## Abstrat

Super poweful and light-weight assertions framework!


## Instruction

B.E. works on the principle of *assertors* a type of functor, or higher-order
function. In RSpec these are know as *matchers*.

    object = "string"
    object.should be.instance_of?(String)
    object.should have.size(6)
